"""Join what is configured against what was actually used.

The whole idea in one sentence: everything in your Claude Code setup charges you
context on every session, and some of it has never once done any work.

An item is *dead weight* when it was loaded into context but never called across
the whole history examined. That is a claim about evidence, not about quality, so
the report always states how many sessions it looked at - "never used in 3
sessions" means very little, "never used in 200" means quite a lot.
